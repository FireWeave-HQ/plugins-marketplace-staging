# scaffold-integration

> Scaffold a new FireweaveAI integration package. Trigger when the user says "create a new integration", "add a Fireweave integration for X", "scaffold an integration plugin", or asks to start building a connector for an external tool. Generates the package directory, manifest, Dockerfile, and entry point matching the conventions in packages/integration-sdk.

# Scaffold a Fireweave Integration

Use this skill to create a new `packages/integration-<name>/` directory in the user's FireweaveAI platform monorepo.

## When to use

- The user wants to start building a new connector (Jira, Asana, PagerDuty, etc.).
- The user references the integration SDK and asks for a starting point.
- The user is in the platform monorepo (verify by checking for `packages/integration-sdk` and `tools/publish/integration.ts`).

Do NOT use this skill if the integration already exists — offer to extend it instead.

## Inputs to gather

1. **`integrationId`** — kebab-case slug, used as the marketplace identifier (e.g. `jira`, `pagerduty`). Verify it does not collide with an existing `packages/integration-*` directory.
2. **Display name** — human-readable (e.g. "Jira", "PagerDuty").
3. **Auth flow type** — one of `oauth2`, `github-app`, `api-key`. Most third-party SaaS tools use `oauth2`.
4. **Webhook delivery scheme** — `hmac-sha256`, `hmac-sha1`, or `none` (rare).
5. **Initial categories** — what kinds of work this integration will produce (e.g. `incident`, `task`, `code-review`).

## What to generate

```
packages/integration-<id>/
├── Dockerfile                    # copy structure from integration-github/Dockerfile
├── package.json                  # @fireweaveai/integration-<id>, deps on @fireweaveai/integration-sdk
├── tsconfig.json                 # extends ../../tsconfig.json with include: ["src"]
├── .env.example                  # documents CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, WEBHOOK_SECRET
├── src/
│   ├── manifest.ts               # IntegrationManifest with the answers above
│   ├── index.ts                  # NATS connect + register against Infrastructure Services Bus
│   └── webhook-handler.ts        # stub that decodes and re-emits webhook events
└── README.md
```

## Generation rules

- Use `@fireweaveai/integration-sdk` (workspace dependency) — never import from another integration package.
- The manifest must export a typed `IntegrationManifest` with `integrationId` matching the directory suffix.
- Webhook URL pattern is fixed: `/api/webhooks/{integrationId}/events`. Do not invent a custom path.
- Match the package.json `scripts.build:image` line from `integration-github/package.json` exactly (same registry/version env var pattern).

## After generation

1. Run `bun install` from the repo root so the workspace links resolve.
2. Run `bun --cwd packages/integration-<id> typecheck` (or `bun build src/index.ts --outdir /tmp/check --target bun`) to confirm types.
3. Tell the user to fill in the `.env` file and then run:

   ```sh
   bun publish:integrations --only integration-<id>
   ```

   This publishes a dev-mode entry to the local marketplace.

## What NOT to do

- Do not invent custom NATS subjects — use the helpers exported by `@fireweaveai/integration-sdk`.
- Do not duplicate webhook verification logic — call the SDK's `verifyHmac()` helper.
- Do not modify `tools/publish/integration.ts` to special-case the new integration — the publish script is intentionally generic.
